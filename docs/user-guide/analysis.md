# Analysis

## Selection and queries

**Home › Select** picks features by clicking or dragging a box (Shift adds, Ctrl removes). It
takes only features that are drawn, in selectable layers: a definition query or a display filter
hiding a feature keeps it out, and a click picks the feature drawn on top among the selectable
layers. **Select By Attributes** takes a SQL clause and checks it as you type; **Select By Location**
picks features that touch another layer's features or lie within a search distance of them (or,
inverted, those that don't). Selected features draw in
cyan and are highlighted in the attribute table, and the selection is synced both ways. Switch,
clear or zoom to the selection, or make a new layer from it.

Select By Attributes and definition queries use SQL `WHERE` clauses:

```sql
pop_est > 100000000 AND continent = 'Asia'
name LIKE 'S%'
iso_a3 IN ('FRA', 'DEU', 'ITA')
gdp_md IS NULL
"OR" = 1          -- double quotes name a field, even a keyword
```

## Geoprocessing tools

![The Analyze tab's tool gallery and the Tools pane with Buffer open; 300 km dissolved buffers around African cities](https://assets.rustgis.app/images/buffer-history.webp)

Open a tool from the **Analyze** tab's gallery, **Analyze › Tools** (the Tools pane,
which searches every tool) or Command Search. Fill in its parameters and click **Run**: the
result is added to the map, and the run is listed under **Analyze › History**. From the command
line or a script (`gp.run`), a built-in tool's parameter with a list of choices, such as Buffer's
units, takes one of them in any letter case (`"meters"` for `Meters`); any other value is an error
that names the choices (Buffer's units no longer take the abbreviations `m`, `mi` or `metres`).
The built-in tools:

| Tool | Toolbox |
| --- | --- |
| Buffer | Analysis › Proximity |
| Clip, Erase | Analysis › Extract / Overlay |
| Dissolve | Data Management › Generalization |
| Minimum Bounding Geometry, Feature To Point, XY Table To Point, Calculate Geometry Attributes | Data Management › Features |
| Simplify | Cartography › Generalization |
| Select Layer By Location / Attribute | Data Management › Layers and Table Views |
| Summarize Within, Summary Statistics | Analysis › Summarize / Statistics |
| Export Features | Conversion |
| IDW Interpolation | Analysis › Interpolation |

Tools honour the current selection: with features selected, only those are processed.

**IDW Interpolation** works like the QGIS tool of the same name: every point weighs on every
cell by 1/distanceᴾ, where P is the distance coefficient (2 by default). Lines and polygons
contribute their vertices. Leave the extent empty to use the input's, or give it as
`xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax` in degrees. The result is a Float32 GeoTIFF layer.

## GeoLibre tools

The desktop app and the command line can also run the
[GeoLibre](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-rust) tool suite: over 1,000 tools from
Whitebox and GeoLibre for terrain analysis (slope, aspect, hillshade, curvature), hydrology
(fill depressions, flow direction and accumulation, watersheds), image processing,
interpolation and vector work. They run on the map's layers and add their outputs as new
layers.

The suite is an optional download, so RustGIS itself stays small: the **GeoLibre runner**, a
single `geolibre` program (about 20 MB to download). In the Tools pane, click
**Install GeoLibre tools** under *GeoLibre tools*: RustGIS downloads the latest runner for your
platform from the [geolibre-rust releases](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-rust/releases/latest),
checks it against its published SHA-256 checksum (which catches a corrupted download; the
release itself is trusted as when you download it by hand) and installs it in its data folder
(`~/.local/share/rustgis/geolibre` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/RustGIS/geolibre`
on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RustGIS\geolibre` on Windows). From the command line,
`gp.installGeolibre` does the same.

To remove it, click **Uninstall** beside *GeoLibre* at the top of the Tools pane, then
**Confirm uninstall** (`gp.uninstallGeolibre` from the command line): RustGIS deletes its
`geolibre` data folder. A runner you located yourself, or one on your `PATH`, is not deleted;
RustGIS goes on using it. You can install the tools again at any time. In the browser,
**Remove** unloads the tools and stops loading them when RustGIS starts.

To install it yourself instead, download the archive for your platform
(`geolibre-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz`, or `.zip` on Windows), unpack it anywhere, and click
**Locate…** to pick the `geolibre` program; RustGIS remembers it.

RustGIS also finds the runner without asking when it is next to the RustGIS program (or in a
`geolibre` folder beside it), on your `PATH`, or named by the `RUSTGIS_GEOLIBRE` environment
variable (the command line uses these). The tools then appear under **GeoLibre** in the Tools
pane and the Browser's toolboxes, grouped by the category and subcategory the runner gives
each tool (Conversion, Hydrology, LiDAR, Projection, Raster, Remote Sensing, Terrain, Vector,
then e.g. **GeoLibre › Terrain › Derivatives**). A runner too old to list subcategories groups
them by category only. Find Tools searches them.

- Raster inputs are passed as their own files; vector layers (or their selection) are written
  in the first raster input's coordinate system, or the UTM zone around the data, so distances
  and areas are in metres. Data spanning more than 40° of longitude stays in degrees.
- Tools that take several layers (a composite's bands, a mosaic's tiles) list them in order:
  **Add** picks a layer, and ▲ ▼ change its place (the order of the bands, for a composite). From
  the command line, name them separated by `;`: `"inputs":"red;green;blue"`. In the desktop app
  a file not open as a layer can be added too: type its path below the list and press Enter.
- Raster outputs are kept inside the project, so they save and reopen with it. Text and table
  reports appear in the tool's messages.
- LiDAR and other inputs RustGIS doesn't open as layers take a file path, read like Add Data
  reads one. Outputs are written to a fresh scratch folder and loaded from there.
- Each run is a separate `geolibre` process, so a tool that fails can't take RustGIS down.
- From the command line: `gp.run={"tool":"geolibre:slope","params":{"input":"dem"}}`;
  `gp.tools` lists every tool's parameters, `gp.geolibre` shows the runner in use and
  `gp.setGeolibre={"path":"…"}` picks one.

In the web app, click **Load GeoLibre tools** in the Tools pane instead. RustGIS
loads geolibre-rust's WebAssembly runner (the `geolibre-wasm` package, from jsDelivr, about
25 MB the first time, then from the browser's cache) and the tools run in the page, in an
in-memory folder: nothing is uploaded. The web app remembers this and loads them again on your
next visit. The runner's code comes from jsDelivr, pinned to one geolibre-wasm release, the
same trust as installing that package. Tools that read files by path (LiDAR files, for instance) need the desktop app,
since a web page has no file system.

In the desktop app and on the command line, RustGIS waits while a tool runs, so a long run on
a large raster or point cloud keeps the window busy until it finishes. In the web app the run
is started in the background and the result is added when it ends, but the tool itself runs
in the page, so the page is busy while it computes.

## Analysis workflows

The Analyze tab's Workflows pane holds guided analyses. Where one needs points, it asks you to
click them on the map:

| Workflow | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Raster Functions | Slope, aspect, hillshade, NDVI, band math (`(b4-b3)/(b4+b3)`), thresholds, resampling |
| Function Editor | Chains raster functions, each on the previous output |
| Suitability Modeler | Scores rasters 1–10 and adds them with weights |
| Visibility Analysis | A viewshed from a point on an elevation raster |
| Exploratory 3D Analysis | A line of sight between two points, split into seen and hidden parts |
| Geostatistical Wizard | An IDW surface from point values |
| Network Analysis | The shortest (or cheapest, by a cost field) route over a line layer |
| Neighborhood Explorer | What lies within a distance of a point, with sums of numeric fields |
| Simulation | Random points in polygons (a fixed number, or from a field × rate) |
| Data Engineering | Counts, nulls, distinct values, min, max and mean of every field |
| Exploratory Analysis | Histograms and correlations of numeric fields |
| Embeddings | The features most like the selected one, by their numeric attributes |
| Data Interop | KML, GPX, CSV with WKT, GeoJSON or CSV |

Rasters these make are kept in the project. **Environments** limit tools to the map view, the full
extent or everywhere, and set the cell size of new rasters. **ModelBuilder** chains tools into
models (a parameter `%1` is step 1's output), and New Model From History turns the
geoprocessing you've run into a model. The **Script** pane runs commands from text, one per line
(`id {json}`).

## Imagery

The Analyze tab's imagery groups open their tools in the Workflows pane:

- **Ortho Mapping** and **Reality Mapping** workspaces mosaic georeferenced images into an
  orthomosaic, or elevation rasters into a surface model that exports as a 3D mesh (OBJ).
- **Georeference** places a raster from control points (column, row, longitude, latitude) or
  stretches it over the map view.
- **Change Detection** (difference, ratio, percent), **Spectral Analysis** (every band at a
  pixel), **Indices** (NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, NBR, NDBI, EVI), **Process** (clip to the view,
  resample) and the **Pixel Editor** (set the pixels inside a polygon).
- **Classification Wizard** (unsupervised k-means) and **Classification Tools** (minimum distance
  from training polygons).
- **Mensuration**: distances along the surface, heights between two points, areas, and volumes
  above or below a base height, with a list of results.

## Deep learning and hosted imagery

**Analyze › Deep Learning Tools** trains a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) on the pixels
under training polygons and classifies every pixel, adding a class raster with a confidence band
and reporting the accuracy on held-back pixels. Trained models stay in the project; **Share ›
Package › Deep Learning** saves one as a package to apply in other projects. **Analyze › Create
Hosted Imagery** cuts a raster into XYZ web map tiles (PNG, transparent outside the raster) with
a TileJSON file and a viewer page.
