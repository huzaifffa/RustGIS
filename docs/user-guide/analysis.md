# Analysis

## Selection and queries

**Home › Select** picks features by clicking or dragging a box (Shift adds, Ctrl removes). It
takes only features that are drawn, in selectable layers: a definition query or a display filter
hiding a feature keeps it out, and a click picks the feature drawn on top among the selectable
layers. **Select By Attributes** takes a SQL clause and checks it as you type; **Select By Location**
picks features that touch another layer's features or lie within a search distance of them (or,
inverted, those that don't). Selected features draw in
cyan and are highlighted in the attribute table, and the selection is synced both ways. Switch,
clear or zoom to the selection, or make a new layer from it (**Make Layer From Selected
Features**, `select.layerFromSelection`).

### The attribute table

++ctrl+t++ (or **Home › Selection › Attributes**) docks the active layer's table under the map.
Click a column header to sort by it (a second click reverses the order, a third unsorts), click a row to select it (++ctrl++ or
++shift++ adds it to the selection), and double-click a cell to change its value. **Selected only**
keeps to the selected rows and **Filter rows…** to the rows with a value containing the words typed.
The toolbar opens Select By Attributes and zooms to, switches, clears or deletes the selection,
and adds or calculates a field.

  <figcaption>The attribute table, with a selection highlighted on the map and in the table.</figcaption>
</figure>

Select By Attributes and definition queries use SQL `WHERE` clauses:

```sql
pop_est > 100000000 AND continent = 'Asia'
name LIKE 'S%'
iso_a3 IN ('FRA', 'DEU', 'ITA')
gdp_md IS NULL
"OR" = 1          -- double quotes name a field, even a keyword
```

## Geoprocessing tools

<figure markdown="span">
  ![The Analyze tab's tool gallery and the Tools pane with Buffer open; 300 km dissolved buffers around African cities](https://assets.rustgis.app/images/buffer-history.webp)
  <figcaption>The Analyze tab's tool gallery and the Tools pane running Buffer.</figcaption>
</figure>

Open a tool from the **Analyze** tab's gallery, **Analyze › Tools** (the Tools pane,
which searches every tool) or Command Search. Fill in its parameters and click **Run**: the
result is added to the map, and the run is listed under **Analyze › History**. From the command
line or a script (`gp.run`), a built-in tool's parameter with a list of choices, such as Buffer's
units, takes one of them in any letter case (`"meters"` for `Meters`); any other value is an error
that names the choices (Buffer's units no longer take the abbreviations `m`, `mi` or `metres`).

The History pane lists each run with when it ran (in UTC). Its **⋯** menu, or a right-click on
the tool's name, copies a run as code, with the parameters it ran with: **Copy as Python** (a
call for the [`rustgis` package](../python.md), one parameter a line), **Copy as Command** (a
line for the Script pane) and **Copy as CLI Command** (`rustgis-cli run --project … --cmd …`,
quoted for a POSIX shell: macOS, Linux, WSL or Git Bash; on Windows' own shells, use the Python
or the Script line). **Open in Tool** opens the tool's form with those values, to change and run
again. **Save as Python Script…** writes the whole history as a script that opens the project
and runs each tool in order; a run that failed is there as a comment. The CLI command and the
script open the project's file: for a project not saved yet, they name the file it would be
saved as, so save it there first; and a project changed since it was saved needs saving again,
or the script opens it without those changes (a layer added since, say). What gives access is
taken out of the code: addresses lose their keys, tokens and passwords, a connection its
password, a pasted private key goes, and a parameter named as a password, key, secret or token
is left empty (`gp.historyCode` and `gp.historyScript` do the same from a script). A secret
written some other way (a token typed into a SQL query, say) can still be there: read the code
before sharing it. A point buffered where the
map was clicked is copied as the command that buffered it, with the point.

The built-in tools:

| Tool | Toolbox |
| --- | --- |
| Buffer | Analysis › Proximity |
| Clip, Erase | Analysis › Extract / Overlay |
| Dissolve | Data Management › Generalization |
| Minimum Bounding Geometry, Feature To Point, XY Table To Point, Calculate Geometry Attributes | Data Management › Features |
| Simplify | Cartography › Generalization |
| Tissot's Indicatrix | Cartography › Projections |
| A5 Grid, Aggregate Points to A5 | Analysis › DGGS |
| Select Layer By Location / Attribute | Data Management › Layers and Table Views |
| Summarize Within, Summary Statistics | Analysis › Summarize / Statistics |
| Export Features | Conversion |
| IDW Interpolation | Analysis › Interpolation |

Tools honour the current selection: with features selected, only those are processed.

**Buffer** distances, and the distance of **Select Layer By Location**, are geodesic: every point
of a buffer's edge is the given distance from the feature, measured on the Earth (a sphere of
radius 6,371 km), wherever the feature is and however far it spans. Each feature is buffered in a
projection centred on it, and a long line or a large polygon in stretches of a few hundred
kilometres, so a 1000 km circle at 60°N reaches as far north as south.

**IDW Interpolation** works like the QGIS tool of the same name: every point weighs on every
cell by 1/distanceᴾ, where P is the distance coefficient (2 by default). Lines and polygons
contribute their vertices. Leave the extent empty to use the input's, or give it as
`xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax` in degrees. The result is a Float32 GeoTIFF layer.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Tissot's indicatrix on the Robinson projection: circles of 800 km every 30°, stretched and sheared toward the poles](https://assets.rustgis.app/images/tissot.webp)
  <figcaption>Tissot's indicatrix on Robinson: equal circles, stretched and sheared by the projection.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Tissot's Indicatrix** shows what the map's projection does to the Earth. It draws the same small circle repeated over a grid: by default circles of 500 km radius every 30° over the whole world. With **Area: Map Extent** it fills the view instead (the whole Earth on the globe), for a country or a state with a smaller spacing and radius.

- **The circles are geodesic,** in longitude/latitude. The map draws each one as the ellipse its projection makes of it, and redraws them when you change the projection: growing circles in Web Mercator, flattened ellipses of equal area in Mollweide.
- **On a flat map, each circle also records Tissot's parameters at its centre** for the projection the map had when the tool ran:
    - `h` and `k`: scale along the meridian and the parallel;
    - `a` and `b`: the ellipse's semi-axes;
    - `area_scale`: `a·b`, which is 1 on an equal-area projection;
    - `max_angle`: the largest angular distortion ω in degrees, 0 on a conformal projection.

    They are measured against the WGS 84 ellipsoid. For a world projection the map draws on a sphere (Mollweide, Robinson…), they can be off by a few tenths of a percent.
- **Making a distortion map:** color the circles by `area_scale` or `max_angle`.

**A5 Grid** and **Aggregate Points to A5** use [A5](https://a5geo.org), a discrete global grid of
pentagonal cells that all have the same area at a given resolution. A count per cell is therefore
already a density, and stays comparable between regions, unlike a grid of cells that change size
with latitude or the map's projection.

- **A5 Grid** makes the cells at a resolution (0–30; each step divides a cell into four: 5 is
  about 33,000 km², 9 about 130 km², 12 about 2 km²) over the map's extent, an input layer's
  polygons (or the extent of its points and lines), or the whole world. **Cells: Overlapping**
  covers the area without gaps; **Center** keeps the cells whose centre is inside. A run makes at
  most 200,000 cells.
- **Aggregate Points to A5** counts a point layer's points (its selection, when there is one) by the
  cell holding them, and keeps only the cells that hold any. It adds `count` and
  `density_per_km2`, and a numeric field's `_sum` and `_mean`, where a feature's value counts
  once in each cell (a multipoint's, however many of its points fall there).
- Both write `a5` (the cell's 64-bit id in hex, as other A5 tools read it: DuckDB, PostgreSQL,
  Python's `pya5`, R), `resolution` and `area_km2`. A cell across the antimeridian, or round a pole, is
  split at ±180° into two parts of one polygon, each within −180° to 180°.

## GeoLibre tools

The desktop app and the command line can also run the
[GeoLibre](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-rust) tool suite: over 1,000 tools from
Whitebox and GeoLibre for terrain analysis (slope, aspect, hillshade, curvature), hydrology
(fill depressions, flow direction and accumulation, watersheds), image processing,
interpolation and vector work. They run on the map's layers and add their outputs as new
layers.

The suite is an optional download, so RustGIS itself stays small: the **GeoLibre runner**, a
single `geolibre` program (about 20 MB to download). In the Tools pane, click
**Install GeoLibre tools** under *GeoLibre tools*: RustGIS downloads the latest runner for your
platform from the [geolibre-rust releases](https://github.com/opengeos/geolibre-rust/releases/latest),
checks it against its published SHA-256 checksum (which catches a corrupted download; the
release itself is trusted as when you download it by hand) and installs it in its data folder
(`~/.local/share/rustgis/geolibre` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/RustGIS/geolibre`
on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RustGIS\geolibre` on Windows). From the command line,
`gp.installGeolibre` does the same.

To remove it, click **Uninstall** beside *GeoLibre* at the top of the Tools pane, then
**Confirm uninstall** (`gp.uninstallGeolibre` from the command line): RustGIS deletes its
`geolibre` data folder. A runner you located yourself, or one on your `PATH`, is not deleted;
RustGIS goes on using it. You can install the tools again at any time. In the browser,
**Remove** unloads the tools and stops loading them when RustGIS starts.

To install it yourself instead, download the archive for your platform
(`geolibre-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz`, or `.zip` on Windows), unpack it anywhere, and click
**Locate…** to pick the `geolibre` program; RustGIS remembers it.

RustGIS also finds the runner without asking when it is next to the RustGIS program (or in a
`geolibre` folder beside it), on your `PATH`, or named by the `RUSTGIS_GEOLIBRE` environment
variable (the command line uses these). The tools then appear under **GeoLibre** in the Tools
pane and the Browser's toolboxes, grouped by the category and subcategory the runner gives
each tool (Conversion, Hydrology, LiDAR, Projection, Raster, Remote Sensing, Terrain, Vector,
then e.g. **GeoLibre › Terrain › Derivatives**). A runner too old to list subcategories groups
them by category only. Find Tools searches them.

- Raster inputs are passed as their own files; vector layers (or their selection) are written
  in the first raster input's coordinate system, or the UTM zone around the data, so distances
  and areas are in metres. Data spanning more than 40° of longitude stays in degrees.
- Tools that take several layers (a composite's bands, a mosaic's tiles) list them in order:
  **Add** picks a layer, and ▲ ▼ change its place (the order of the bands, for a composite). From
  the command line, name them separated by `;`: `"inputs":"red;green;blue"`. In the desktop app
  a file not open as a layer can be added too: type its path below the list and press Enter.
- Raster outputs are kept inside the project, so they save and reopen with it. Text and table
  reports appear in the tool's messages.
- LiDAR and other inputs RustGIS doesn't open as layers take a file path, read like Add Data
  reads one. Outputs are written to a fresh scratch folder and loaded from there.
- Each run is a separate `geolibre` process, so a tool that fails can't take RustGIS down.
- From the command line: `gp.run={"tool":"geolibre:slope","params":{"input":"dem"}}`;
  `gp.tools` lists every tool's parameters, `gp.geolibre` shows the runner in use and
  `gp.setGeolibre={"path":"…"}` picks one.

In the web app, click **Load GeoLibre tools** in the Tools pane instead. RustGIS
loads geolibre-rust's WebAssembly runner (the `geolibre-wasm` package, from jsDelivr, about
25 MB the first time, then from the browser's cache) and the tools run in the page, in an
in-memory folder: nothing is uploaded. The web app remembers this and loads them again on your
next visit. The runner's code comes from jsDelivr, pinned to one geolibre-wasm release, the
same trust as installing that package. Tools that read files by path (LiDAR files, for instance) need the desktop app,
since a web page has no file system.

In the desktop app and on the command line, RustGIS waits while a tool runs, so a long run on
a large raster or point cloud keeps the window busy until it finishes. In the web app the run
is started in the background and the result is added when it ends, but the tool itself runs
in the page, so the page is busy while it computes.

## Analysis workflows

The Analyze tab's Workflows pane holds guided analyses. Where one needs points, it asks you to
click them on the map:

| Workflow | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Raster Functions | Slope, aspect, hillshade, NDVI, band math (`(b4-b3)/(b4+b3)`), thresholds, resampling |
| Function Editor | Chains raster functions, each on the previous output |
| Suitability Modeler | Scores rasters 1–10 and adds them with weights |
| Visibility Analysis | A viewshed from a point on an elevation raster |
| Exploratory 3D Analysis | A line of sight between two points, split into seen and hidden parts |
| Geostatistical Wizard | An IDW surface from point values |
| Network Analysis | The shortest (or cheapest, by a cost field) route over a line layer |
| Neighborhood Explorer | What lies within a distance of a point, with sums of numeric fields |
| Simulation | Random points in polygons (a fixed number, or from a field × rate) |
| Data Engineering | Counts, nulls, distinct values, min, max and mean of every field |
| Exploratory Analysis | Histograms and correlations of numeric fields |
| Embeddings | The features most like the selected one, by their numeric attributes |
| Data Interop | KML, GPX, CSV with WKT, GeoJSON or CSV |

Rasters these make are kept in the project. **Environments** limit tools to the map view, the full
extent or everywhere, and set the cell size of new rasters. The **Script** pane runs commands from
text, one per line (`id {json}`); its box grows with the script down to the bottom of the pane,
short of the buttons, and then scrolls, so **Run** stays in view. It colours them as you type, in
both themes: `#` comments in green italics, the command id, and the JSON's strings, numbers and
`true`/`false`/`null`; an id no command has, or one that can't run in a script (`ui.*`, `script.*`,
`notebook.run`), and parameters that aren't valid JSON are red and underlined. A script is read to
its 10,000th line; any further are dimmed, as Run doesn't read them. Typing a line's first word
opens a list of the commands it starts, under the cursor: ↑/↓ to move, Enter or Tab to accept,
Escape to close, or a click. Beside it, the highlighted command's help: its signature (keys with `?`
may be left out), its name, its parameters one per line, and where it sits in the interface.
Accepting a command on a line of its own adds its braces: with its required keys ready for their
values, the cursor at the first (`map.goToXY {"lon": , "lat": }`), or empty with the cursor inside
when every key may be left out; a command with no parameters gets none, and a line that has
parameters keeps them. While you type a command's parameters (the cursor inside its `{…}`), the same help stays by the cursor;
Escape closes it. A `{` typed closes itself, the cursor inside, unless text follows it or it's in a
string or a comment; a `}` typed before a `}` steps over it, and Backspace in an empty `{}` deletes
both. Pasting adds nothing.

## ModelBuilder

<figure markdown="span">
  ![ModelBuilder after a run: Cities buffered by 300 km clip the Rivers into "Rivers near cities", and Countries are dissolved by continent; every node is ticked and the results are on the map](https://assets.rustgis.app/images/modelbuilder.webp)
  <figcaption>A model after its run: each node is ticked, and its outputs are layers on the map.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Analyze › Model Builder** opens a model in a view of its own, a tab beside the maps and
layouts. A model is a graph of three kinds of node: **inputs** (blue) name layers of the map,
**tools** (amber) are geoprocessing tools, and **outputs** (green) keep a result as a layer of
their name.

- Drag a tool from the palette on the left onto the canvas, or click it; **+ Input** and
  **+ Output** add the other nodes.
- Drag from a node's right port to another node's left port to connect them. A tool's left
  ports are its layer parameters; a parameter that isn't connected can name a layer of the map
  instead, in the settings on the right.
- Select a node to set its parameters there; **Keep this result** adds an output for it.
- Drag the background to pan, Ctrl+wheel (or pinch) to zoom; **Arrange** lays the nodes out
  along the flow and **Fit** shows the whole model. Delete removes the selected node or wire,
  Ctrl+D copies a node, Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y undo and redo.
- Problems are listed below the canvas as you build (an input without a layer, a required
  parameter left empty, a loop) and the nodes concerned are marked; **Run** waits until there
  are none. The tools then run in flow order, and each node shows how it fared. A result that
  only feeds other tools is removed once the model has run; the outputs, and tools at the end
  of the flow, stay on the map. A run that fails is undone as a whole.
- **Save** keeps the model in the project; **Export** writes it as a `*.model.json` file, which
  **Import** (or dropping the file on the window) opens again. A model from a file may not read
  or write files. **Copy Command** copies a `model.run` command that runs the model from the
  Script pane, the command line or Python.

The Workflows pane's Models section lists the project's models, and New Model From History turns
the geoprocessing you've run into one. Models made as steps (`model.new` with `steps`, where `%1`
stands for step 1's output) run as they always have until they are saved from ModelBuilder, which
shows them as a graph and saves them as one. The `model.*` commands build, check (`model.validate`),
save and run models without the canvas:

```json
{"graph": {"nodes": [
   {"id": "i1", "kind": "input", "layer": "Cities"},
   {"id": "t1", "kind": "tool", "tool": "buffer", "params": {"distance": 50}},
   {"id": "o1", "kind": "output", "name": "City zones"}],
 "edges": [
   {"from": "i1", "fromPort": "out", "to": "t1", "toPort": "input"},
   {"from": "t1", "fromPort": "out", "to": "o1", "toPort": "in"}]}}
```

## Imagery

The Analyze tab's imagery groups open their tools in the Workflows pane:

- **Ortho Mapping** and **Reality Mapping** workspaces mosaic georeferenced images into an
  orthomosaic, or elevation rasters into a surface model that exports as a 3D mesh (OBJ).
- **Georeference** places a raster from control points (column, row, longitude, latitude) or
  stretches it over the map view. Those only shift and scale a north-up grid, as RustGIS's
  geotransform has no rotation. With `transform` (`raster.georeference`) the points are fitted by any
  of the Control Point Fit transforms and the raster is warped onto a new north-up grid covering the
  warped image: `{"layer": "scan", "transform": "spline", "points": [[column, row, x, y], …],
  "pointsCrs": "EPSG:4326", "crs": 32613, "resampling": "bilinear", "cellSize": 5, "name": "warped",
  "path": "warped.tif"}`. `pointsCrs` is the coordinate system the points' x and y are in (default
  EPSG:4326) and `crs` the output's (default `pointsCrs`, so nothing is reprojected unless asked).
  Each output cell is taken back through the fit, after reprojection, to the image and sampled there
  with `nearest`, `bilinear` (the default) or `cubic`; cells that fall outside the image are no
  data, or see-through for a colour image, which gains an alpha band for it (a grey byte image
  becomes grey with alpha; alpha is 0–255 in every pixel type). An image warped into a geographic
  `crs` gets square cells in degrees, and one that would span more than 180° of longitude is
  refused: give a projected `crs`. The cell is about the source pixel's size on the ground unless
  `cellSize` (output units) says otherwise. The result replaces the layer's raster, or becomes a new
  layer with `name`; `path` also writes it as a cloud-optimised GeoTIFF, which then is the layer's
  file. A raster opened from an overview is warped at that reduced resolution, and the result says
  so.
- **Control Point Fit** (`raster.gcpFit`) fits a similarity, affine, projective, second- or
  third-order polynomial, or thin plate spline transform to control points and reports how well
  it holds: each point's residual in pixels and map units, the RMSE, and each point's error when
  it is left out of the fit. With `compare` it fits them all and recommends the simplest whose
  leave-one-out error is close to the best.
- **Change Detection** (difference, ratio, percent), **Spectral Analysis** (every band at a
  pixel), **Indices** (NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, NBR, NDBI, EVI), **Process** (clip to the view, to a
  box, or to a polygon layer's selected or all polygons, with the cells outside them no-data;
  resample) and the **Pixel Editor** (set the pixels inside a polygon).
- **Mosaic Rasters** (`raster.mosaic`) merges tiles of one grid, such as the 1 km tiles of a state
  elevation model, into one raster in their own coordinate system and cell size, optionally
  written to a GeoTIFF: `{"inputs": ["dgm_1.tif", "dgm_2.tif", …], "path": "dem.tif"}`. Inputs
  are layers or file paths; where they overlap, the first one with data wins. Tiles in different
  coordinate systems or cell sizes, or opened from an overview, are refused rather than quietly
  resampled, as are tiles whose cells don't line up; the mosaic has to fit in memory (120 million
  values: cells times bands).
- **Classification Wizard** (unsupervised k-means) and **Classification Tools** (minimum distance
  from training polygons).
- **Mensuration**: distances along the surface, heights between two points, areas, and volumes
  above or below a base height, with a list of results.

### Trend analysis

**Trend Analysis** (`cube.trend`, in the Workflows pane after Change Detection) asks of a series of
rasters whether each cell is changing, how fast, and how surely: an NDVI series greening or
browning, a temperature series warming. Each cell gets **Sen's slope**, the median of the slopes
between every two dates, which holds up against outliers such as a cloud left in an NDVI scene,
and a **Mann–Kendall** test of whether the trend is significant.

- **The series** (a data cube) is any of:
  - raster layers, a date each, dated by their names (`ndvi_2024-06-01`, MODIS's `A2024153`,
    `2024-06`, a year) or by the `dates` given: `{"layers": ["ndvi_2015", "ndvi_2016", …]}`;
  - a Zarr variable along its time dimension, by its layer or its store, as for Summarise over time
    (see [Data](data.md)): `{"path": "air.zarr", "variable": "t2m"}`;
  - a raster of several bands, a date each, as Earth Engine and openEO export, dated by the bands'
    names or `dates`;
  - a STAC collection's band (desktop), read in place from its cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs over an
    area, as Add as Time Series finds them (see [Web data](web-data.md)): `{"url":
    "https://data.inpe.br/bdc/stac/v1", "collection": "mod13q1-6.1", "asset": "NDVI", "bbox": [-46,
    -10.95, -40.35, -2.7], "start": "2001", "end": "2025"}`. Each date's files (a grid tile each,
    MODIS's h13v09 and h13v10 for Piauí) are put together on one grid, each scaled as its own
    metadata says (NDVI's 0.0001). `"cellSize"` reads the level of the files' overviews nearest
    it (`1000` reads MODIS's 926 m one), which reads far fewer bytes; by default the full images.
    An overview is often one pixel taken from each block (the Brazil Data Cube's are), so a cell is
    then one 250 m pixel, which can differ much from the place's mean; `"resampling": "average"`
    makes each cell the mean of the full images' pixels in it, reading those (16 times the bytes
    at 1 km from 250 m). It needs every file's corner on a cell's corner, as MODIS's tiles are; a
    file on a grid shifted by part of a cell is refused: set `"resampling": "nearest"` and run it
    again. A file's no-data value is skipped, from its header or from its asset's metadata
    (`raster:bands` `nodata`). Where two tiles' files overlap on a date (items without a tile
    name are told apart by footprint), a cell is the mean of their values, while the data cube on
    the map shows one of them. This source is given as parameters (a script, the assistant, the
    command line); `cube.trend` waits for the search and the reads with no Cancel, the app with
    it, as for a Zarr store's address, so keep the area and period small there, or run a large
    one from the command line.

  The rasters have to be on one grid; put them on one first with Raster Functions › Resample.
- **The test:** NDVI and temperature series are autocorrelated, which makes the plain test report
  too many significant cells, so the default is the **modified Mann–Kendall** test of **Hamed &
  Rao (1998)**: the variance of S is corrected by the autocorrelation of the detrended series'
  ranks, at the lags significant at the test's level. The others:
  - **Yue & Wang (2004)**, from the lag-1 autocorrelation of the detrended series;
  - **Seasonal** (Hirsch et al. 1982), for a series with a yearly cycle: the test is made within
    each season (`"seasons": 12` for months, 23 for 16-day composites) and summed, and Sen's slope
    comes from pairs within a season;
  - **Mann–Kendall** for independent values.

  The definitions follow `pymannkendall`'s, ties included.
- **Options:** the significance level (`"alpha"`, 0.05), the slope per year or per decade (from the
  real dates, so uneven spacing is handled), a period (`start`, `end`; a whole number from 1000 to
  9999 is a year, and an end given as a year or a month takes all of it), a season across years
  (`"months": [12, 1, 2]`), and the dates a cell needs (`"minValid"`, by default half of them, at
  least 4). Missing values and no-data are skipped cell by cell.
- **Outputs:** four 32-bit layers, kept in the project as GeoTIFFs: Sen's slope, the test's Z, the
  p-value, and the slope where p < alpha (no-data elsewhere), the one a map usually shows on a
  diverging ramp centred on 0.
- **Size:** the cube is read into memory a slice at a time, up to 64 million values (cells times
  dates; 16 million in the web app) and 2,000 dates. A STAC collection's area is read in **pieces**
  instead, bands of rows each within that block (a whole number of the files' tile rows where they fit),
  eight dates at a time, and the outputs are put together: Piauí at about 1 km over 25 years of
  16-day composites (645 × 984 cells × 576 dates) is six pieces. Its area is up to 25 million
  cells. The seasonal test compares only pairs within a season, so its time limit counts those.
  It runs in the background with progress and Cancel.

## Deep learning and hosted imagery

**Analyze › Deep Learning Tools** trains a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) on the pixels
under training polygons and classifies every pixel, adding a class raster with a confidence band
and reporting the accuracy on held-back pixels. Trained models stay in the project; **Publish ›
Share As › Deep Learning** saves one as a package to apply in other projects. **Analyze › Create
Hosted Imagery** cuts a raster into XYZ web map tiles (PNG, transparent outside the raster) with
a TileJSON file and a viewer page.
