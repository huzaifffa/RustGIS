# Web Data

**Home › Web Data** gathers public web services and catalogs: the ones that cover the whole world
in one alphabetical list, and those that cover one country in a submenu named after it. Each
opens in the Web Data pane on the right, beside the map it searches. Unless a section says
otherwise, they work in the web app too: their documents and tiles are fetched like any other.
They reach the network, so the [AI Assistant](assistant.md) asks before it runs their commands,
and plugins need the network permission. `ui.dialog` opens a panel on a search with `"search"`
(`{"name": "nasaEarthdata", "search": "sea surface temperature"}`).

Data added by its address, from a web server or an S3 bucket, is described in
[Data](data.md#s3-buckets) and [Files on the web](data-formats.md#files-on-the-web).

## STAC catalogs

**Home › Web Data › STAC Search…** searches a [STAC](https://stacspec.org) API for imagery and
other assets: by collection, dates, the most cloud cover and (by default) where the map is. The
default API is Element 84's [Earth Search](https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1)
(Sentinel-2, Landsat, NAIP, Copernicus DEM and Sentinel-1 on AWS); Microsoft's [Planetary
Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1) is offered beside it, and any
STAC API with item search works. **Collections** lists what the API offers, and **Find Items** shows up to 50 items as cards
(with "Showing 50 of 1234 items" when the API says how many match) and draws their footprints as
a layer. Each card has the item's preview picture when it has one, its id, a collection · date ·
cloud cover line, and **Zoom** (to the item), the asset to add, **Add** and **Details** (the item's
properties). The asset chosen at first is `visual` (true colour) when there is one, else the first
GeoTIFF, else the first point cloud, else the first data asset. A cloud-optimised GeoTIFF is read in place, the tiles each view needs by range
(see [Files on the web](data-formats.md#files-on-the-web)); other assets download whole.

The commands do the same: `stac.collections` (`"url"`), `stac.search` (`"collections"`,
`"bbox"` as `[west, south, east, north]` or `"view"`, `"datetime"` such as
`2024-06-01/2024-06-30`, `"limit"`, `"maxCloud"`, `"footprints"`, and `"properties": true` for
every property of each item rather than its date and cloud cover), and `stac.addAsset` with
an item `stac.search` returned (`"item"`) or an item's address (`"url"`) and `"asset"`:

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'stac.search={"collections":"sentinel-2-l2a","bbox":[7.4,46.9,7.5,47],"datetime":"2024-07-01/2024-07-31","maxCloud":20}' --cmd 'stac.addAsset={"url":"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1/collections/sentinel-2-l2a/items/S2B_32TLS_20240727_0_L2A","asset":"scl"}'
```

Assets are added by their web address: one in a cloud store's own protocol (`s3://`) is refused
with a message saying so, and an item on the web can't point into the local network. A Planetary
Computer asset (in Azure Blob Storage) is signed first: RustGIS asks the Planetary Computer's
token service for its storage container's token and reuses it for half an hour. The token is part
of the layer's address, so a project saved with one reads it again only while the token lasts
(about an hour): add the asset again after that. A `?stac=` link opens the web app on an item or a
collection ([web app links](../installation.md)). Searches reach the network, so the [AI
Assistant](assistant.md) asks before it runs them, and plugins need the network permission.

### Data cubes on the time slider

When the items found span several dates, **Add as Time Series** (desktop; `stac.addCube`) adds a
band of them as a data cube: a collection's cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs, with one file per tile, date
and band, such as INPE's [Brazil Data Cube](https://data.inpe.br/bdc/) or Sentinel-2 on Earth Search.

- **Search:** the collection is searched over the area (the map's, or `"bbox"`) and the period
  (`"start"`, `"end"`), page after page, up to 2,000 items.
- **Grouping:** items go by the grid tile they cover (`grid:code`, `s2:mgrs_tile`, Landsat's WRS
  path and row, the Brazil Data Cube's `bdc:tiles`, else their bounding box), and by day.
- **Layers:** each tile becomes a tile layer read in place, a file per date. The time slider shows
  the last date in its window, and a tile with no date in it draws nothing. The slider turns on
  over the dates when it is off.
- **Range:** a fixed `"range"` (`[0, 0.9]` for NDVI) is the same for every date and tile, so a grey
  means one value throughout. It is in the band's own units: its `raster:bands` (or `eo:bands`)
  scale and offset turn it into the files' stored values. Without one, each file is stretched on
  its own, between its 2nd and 98th percentiles.
- **Saved with the project:** each tile's dates and addresses.
- **Web app:** a server that doesn't allow the browser to fetch its files (CORS), as the Brazil Data
  Cube's doesn't, works on the desktop only.
- **Its trend:** the same search, given to Trend Analysis (`cube.trend` with `collection`,
  `asset`, `bbox`, `start` and `end`), reads the values over the area and works out each cell's
  trend: see [Trend analysis](analysis.md#trend-analysis).

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'stac.addCube={"url":"https://data.inpe.br/bdc/stac/v1","collection":"S2-16D-2","asset":"NDVI","bbox":[-55.9,-12.6,-55.5,-12.35],"start":"2024-08-01","end":"2025-06-30","range":[0,0.9]}' --cmd 'time.export={"path":"ndvi.gif"}'
```

### Static catalogs

Many catalogs are plain files rather than an API: a `catalog.json` linking to child catalogs and
`collection.json` files, which link to their items. Give STAC Search the address of one (or pick
Planet Open Data, Portolan or Vantor Open Data from its list) and the **Collection** row becomes
**Catalog**: its child catalogs and collections are listed, and picking one shows its own children
(an **↑** entry goes back up; **Browse** reads the list again). **Find Items** walks the catalog from
the one picked, several documents at a time, and keeps the items that match the dates, the most
cloud cover and, with **Only where the map is** ticked, the map's extent. It lists the first 50 items it finds that match, sorted by date (the walk goes in the catalog's
order, so in a large catalog these aren't the earliest or latest: pick a catalog further down for
others). Undated items, and items without a footprint, are kept. A collection whose data
are its own assets (as many Portolan collections' GeoParquet and PMTiles files are) is listed as
an item of its own. A walk reads at most 400 documents and goes at most 8 catalogs deep; when it
stops early, it says so: pick a catalog further down. Items are added as from an API: a
cloud-optimised GeoTIFF is read in place, GeoParquet and FlatGeobuf by range, PMTiles a tile at a
time.

`stac.collections` with a static catalog's `"url"` lists its children (`"id"` is each one's
address), and `stac.search` walks one, with `"phase"` (`"pre"` or `"post"`) for catalogs of events:

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'stac.search={"url":"https://vantor-opendata.s3.amazonaws.com/events/Mexico-Hurricane-Simon-Oct-2026/collection.json","phase":"post"}'
```

The services below are STAC Search opened on one API or catalog, with the dialog titled after
the service. Their commands (`ui.stac.planet`, `ui.stac.portolan`, `ui.stac.sentinel2`,
`ui.stac.vantor`, `ui.stac.usgsLidar`) take `"catalog"` (a catalog's or collection's address to
start from), `"phase"` and `"search": true` (find items at once).

### Planet Open Data

**Home › Web Data › Planet Open Data…** browses Planet's [disaster data
releases](https://source.coop/planet/disasterdata) on Source Cooperative: imagery of earthquakes,
floods, fires and storms from PlanetScope, SkySat and Pelican, before and after the event, licensed
CC BY-NC 4.0. Pick an event (and, below it, its pre-event or post-event imagery or one collection),
then **Find Items**; **Add** adds a scene's `visual` image.

### Portolan

**Home › Web Data › Portolan…** opens the [Portolan
registry](https://github.com/portolan-sdi/portolan-registry), a catalog of the open data catalogs
published with Portolan (cities, regions and agencies, most in Europe). Pick a publisher's catalog,
then a theme or collection, then **Find Items**: each collection's files (GeoParquet, PMTiles and
others) are listed, and **Add** adds the one chosen (`visual` first, often a PMTiles archive).

### Sentinel-2 Explorer

<figure markdown="span">
  ![The Sentinel-2 Explorer in the Web Data pane over Bern: the clearest recent scenes as cards with previews, and their footprints drawn on the map](https://assets.rustgis.app/images/web-data.webp)
  <figcaption>The Sentinel-2 Explorer: the clearest recent scenes where the map is, with their footprints.</figcaption>
</figure>

**Home › Web Data › Sentinel-2 Explorer…** searches Earth Search's Sentinel-2 Collection 1 Level-2A
scenes (`sentinel-2-c1-l2a`) where the map is, over the last 90 days and with at most 20 % cloud
cover, clearest first (sorted by cloud cover). **Add** adds the true colour image (`visual`);
the asset list beside each scene offers its bands (`red`, `nir`, `swir16`, `scl`…), each a
cloud-optimised GeoTIFF read in place. `stac.search` sorts with `"sortby"`
(`"eo:cloud_cover"`, `"-datetime"` for newest first) on APIs that sort.

### Vantor

**Home › Web Data › Vantor…** browses [Vantor](https://vantor.com)'s open data (formerly Maxar's
Open Data program): very high resolution imagery of disasters, one collection per event. Pick an
event and a phase (before or after the event), then **Find Items**; **Add** adds a scene's
`visual` cloud-optimised GeoTIFF.

### USGS LiDAR

**Home › Web Data › United States › USGS LiDAR…** searches the USGS 3D Elevation Program's LiDAR
point clouds on the Planetary Computer (`3dep-lidar-copc`) where the map is: zoom to a town first.
Each tile's `data` asset is a COPC file, signed with the Planetary Computer's token and added as a
LiDAR point cloud (an evenly spread sample of its points, see [Formats](data.md#formats)). A tile is
downloaded whole, often tens of megabytes, so adding one takes a while.

## Overture Maps

**Home › Web Data › Overture Maps…** adds [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org)' open data:
buildings, places, transportation (segments and connectors), administrative divisions, base
layers (land use, land, land cover, water, infrastructure, bathymetry) and addresses, from the
latest release (or one named with `"release"`). Two ways:

- **The features where the map is.** A theme's type is a few hundred GeoParquet files, each
  covering an area; Overture's [STAC catalog](https://stac.overturemaps.org) gives every file's
  extent, so only the files that cover the map's view are read, in place by range like any
  GeoParquet by address (see [Files on the web](data-formats.md#files-on-the-web)), and each
  becomes a layer read a view at a time. Zoom to a city or smaller: a view that takes more than six
  files is refused (a country takes dozens).
- **Map tiles of the whole world**, from the theme's PMTiles archive: every zoom, drawn a layer per
  type. Some themes' tiles hold their features only when zoomed in (places from zoom 14).

`overture.add` does the same (`"theme"`, `"type"`, `"bbox"` or the view, `"tiles": true` for the
tiles):

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'map.zoomToExtent={"extent":[7.40,46.93,7.47,46.97]}' --cmd 'overture.add={"theme":"buildings"}' --cmd 'overture.add={"theme":"transportation"}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"bern.png"}'
```

The data's licences differ by theme (OpenStreetMap's ODbL for most, CDLA Permissive 2.0 for
places); the layer says which.

## Source Cooperative

**Home › Web Data › Source Cooperative…** lists [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop)'s
featured products (or an account's), browses a product's folders and adds a file by its address on
the data proxy (`https://data.source.coop/<account>/<product>/…`): GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf,
cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs and PMTiles are read in place, other files downloaded.
`sourcecoop.products` (`"account"`) and `sourcecoop.list` (`"account"`, `"product"`, `"path"`)
list them; a listed file's `"url"` is added with `layer.addUrl`. Like STAC searches, these reach the
network: the AI Assistant asks first and plugins need the network permission.

## Natural Earth

**Home › Web Data › Natural Earth…** is the Source Cooperative browser locked to
[Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com)'s public domain map data as Source Cooperative
holds it (`opengeos/natural-earth`): countries, states, coastlines, land, ocean, rivers, lakes,
glaciers, urban areas, airports, railways and more. It opens on the `pmtiles/` folder, whose
archives are added as tile layers read in place; the `geoparquet/`, `geojson/`, `gpkg/` and
`shapefiles/` folders hold the same themes as files, added as layers. With commands:
`sourcecoop.list` (`{"account": "opengeos", "product": "natural-earth", "path": "pmtiles/"}`), then
`layer.addUrl` with a file's `"url"`.

## Fields of the World

**Home › Web Data › Fields of the World…** adds the agricultural field boundaries the
[Fields of the World](https://fieldsofthe.world) model found in Sentinel-2 imagery, worldwide, one
year at a time (2017 to 2025; 2nd Edition, CC BY 4.0). Each year is a PMTiles archive on Source
Cooperative read in place. Fields are drawn from zoom 9, filled and outlined by the model's score
(0 to 100: red below 45, through orange and yellow, to green from 80); zoomed out, field density
cells are drawn instead, coloured by the share of each cell covered by fields: **Add field
boundaries** and **Add field density** add each. **Score threshold** hides the fields scoring below
it. `fieldsOfTheWorld.add` does the same (`"year"`, `"draw"`:
`both`, `fields` or `density`, `"minScore"`):

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'map.goToXY={"lon":-93.6,"lat":42.03,"scale":40000}' --cmd 'fieldsOfTheWorld.add={"year":2024,"minScore":40}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"fields.png"}'
```

The look is the tile layer's own style layers (`map.addTiles` takes MapLibre style layers as
`"styleLayers"`, drawing vector tiles in place of their default colours).

## OpenStreetMap and administrative boundaries

**Home › Web Data › OpenStreetMap…** (`osm.download`) downloads OpenStreetMap data where the map
is from an [Overpass](https://overpass-api.de) server: a preset (buildings, roads, railways, water,
land use, parks, points of interest or administrative boundaries) or tag filters such as
`amenity=cafe, shop`. The answer becomes up to three layers, points, lines and polygons: closed
ways that are areas (buildings, land use and the like, as OSM reads their tags) are polygons, and
multipolygon and boundary relations are assembled from their members. A layer's fields are its 25
most common tags, the rest in `other_tags` as GDAL writes them. The area can be up to 0.25 square
degrees (about 50 × 50 km), and an answer up to 50,000 elements: the public servers are shared, so
a larger area is better read from an extract (`.osm.pbf`). `"url"` names another Overpass server
when the public one is busy.

**Home › Web Data › Boundaries…** (`boundaries.add`) adds a country's administrative boundaries from
[geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org) (CC BY 4.0): the country itself (`ADM0`), its states
or provinces (`ADM1`) and finer divisions down to `ADM5` where they exist, simplified for the map.
`boundaries.countries` lists the countries.

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'osm.download={"bbox":[7.44,46.944,7.456,46.952],"preset":"buildings"}' --cmd 'boundaries.add={"country":"KEN","level":"ADM1"}'
```

Both reach the network: the [AI Assistant](assistant.md) asks before it runs them, and plugins need
the network permission. OpenStreetMap data is © OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL).

## NASA

NASA's data comes two ways: **NASA Earthdata…** adds imagery that NASA serves as map tiles, and
**NASA Earthaccess…** finds the data files themselves. **Earthdata GIS…** (see
[Web services](#web-services)) searches NASA's portal of map and feature services.

### NASA Earthdata

**Home › Web Data › NASA Earthdata…** lists the layers of NASA's
[Global Imagery Browse Services](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/engage/open-data-services-software/earthdata-developer-portal/gibs-api)
(GIBS) in Web Mercator: more than a thousand layers of satellite imagery and science data (MODIS,
VIIRS, Landsat, sea surface temperature, aerosols, fires…), grouped by mission or instrument (the
first part of their names) and searched by words. Most layers change day by day: **Date**
(YYYY-MM-DD) picks the day they are added at, and empty adds the service's default (its latest).
The same layer can be added at several dates, each a layer named with its date. A WMTS layer with a time dimension works the same way in any service,
and with commands `service.add` takes `"time"`:

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'service.add={"url":"https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wmts/epsg3857/best/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml","layer":"MODIS_Terra_CorrectedReflectance_TrueColor","time":"2024-06-01"}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"gibs.png"}'
```

A service may name its time instead of dating it: swisstopo's layers on
[geo.admin.ch](https://docs.geo.admin.ch/visualize-data/wmts.html) are drawn at `current`, their
default, so they need no `"time"`:

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'service.add={"url":"https://wmts.geo.admin.ch/EPSG/3857/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml","layer":"ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe"}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"swisstopo.png"}'
```

### NASA Earthaccess

**Home › Web Data › NASA Earthaccess…** searches [NASA Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov)
as GeoLibre's Earthaccess panel does, through NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR):

1. **Dataset**: pick one of the **Popular datasets** (ICESat-2 ATL03/ATL06/ATL08, GEDI L2A/L2B/L4A,
   HLS Landsat and Sentinel-2, NASADEM), or search by keyword (`earthdata.collections`), keeping
   to **Earthdata Cloud only** if you like, and pick one of the results. A popular dataset is its
   cloud-hosted, newest version.
2. **Granules**: set the start and end dates (the last 30 days at first) and press **Search this
   view** (`earthdata.granules`): the granules where the map is, newest first, 25 at a time
   (**Load more**). Their footprints are drawn as a layer.
3. Each granule is a card with its preview, date, size, cloud cover and number of files, and
   **Add** (its first GeoTIFF, added as a COG read in place), **Download** (its first file, in
   the browser), **Zoom** and **Details** (its page on Earthdata Search). **Files** lists every file,
   each GeoTIFF with its own **Add**.

Searching needs no account, but NASA's data servers ask for an
[Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov) token to read most files. Paste one in the pane's
**Earthdata Login** section (or run `earthdata.login`): it is kept until RustGIS closes, never in
the project, and sent only over HTTPS to NASA's Earthdata data servers (`*.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov`
and `*.earthdata.nasa.gov`), never to the login server itself; a redirect away from them (to the
presigned address the file is served from) goes without it. A file the token doesn't open says
so (an expired token, or a dataset whose EULA you haven't accepted on Earthdata Login).

In the web app, searching and footprints work, but NASA's data servers don't let web pages read
their files (they send no CORS headers), so GeoTIFFs are added in the desktop app; **Download**
still opens a file in a new tab, where Earthdata Login asks you to sign in.

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'earthdata.collections={"keyword":"GEDI biomass","cloudHosted":true}'
rustgis-cli run --sample --cmd 'earthdata.granules={"shortName":"HLSL30","bbox":[-90,42.5,-89,43.5],"start":"2024-06-01","end":"2024-06-30"}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"hls.png"}'
rustgis-cli run --sample --cmd 'earthdata.login={"token":"…"}' --cmd 'layer.addUrl={"url":"https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/lp-prod-protected/HLSL30.020/…/….B04.tif"}'
```

## Open-data portals

**Home › Web Data › Search Open Data…** (`portal.search`) finds datasets by text in an open-data
portal and lists, for each, the resources RustGIS can add, the best format first:

- **data.gov and CKAN catalogues**: [catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov) by default, or a
  CKAN site by its address (`https://open.canada.ca/data`, `https://data.gov.uk`…). GeoJSON,
  FlatGeobuf, GeoParquet, GeoPackage, KML, zipped Shapefiles, GeoTIFF, CSV, WMS, WFS and ArcGIS
  REST resources are offered; web pages, PDFs and the like are left out.
- **Socrata**: every Socrata site through its discovery API, or one site such as
  `data.cityofnewyork.us`. Datasets with a location column are added as their GeoJSON export (up
  to 50,000 rows).
- **ArcGIS Hub**: [hub.arcgis.com](https://hub.arcgis.com) or an organisation's Hub site; its
  feature services.

**Only where the map is** keeps to datasets covering the map's view. A file is added by its address
(`portal.add`, read in place when it can be, as **Add Data From URL…** does); a service opens
**Add From Service…** connected to it, to pick its layer (`portal.add` takes the first layer with
features unless `"layer"` names one, or an ArcGIS map or image service's whole map). A search
lists up to 50 datasets.

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'portal.search={"portal":"socrata","url":"data.cityofnewyork.us","query":"parks"}'
rustgis-cli run --sample --cmd 'portal.add={"url":"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/enfh-gkve.geojson?$limit=50000","name":"Parks","portal":"https://api.us.socrata.com"}'
```

An address a portal lists is judged as one found in a document on the web: it may not point into
the local network. Both commands reach the network, so the AI Assistant asks before it runs them,
and plugins need the network permission. A dataset's licence is the portal's: its page (the
**Page** link) says what it is.

### Web services

Several **Home › Web Data** entries open the same search on one service, with its own choices
(`portal.search` with the `"portal"` in brackets):

| **United States › US Federal GIS…**, **US State GIS…**, **US Local GIS…** | The public GIS portals of 24 federal agencies (by department), every state and the District of Columbia, and 146 counties and cities (by state): pick a group and a portal; an ArcGIS organisation's public items (`arcgis-portal` with `"org"`), or a Socrata site | The service, or the file |
| **United States › USGS 3DEP DEM…** (`usgs-dem`) | USGS elevation models from [The National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov) where the map is: 1 m, 1/9, 1/3 (the default) or 1 arc-second, or Alaska's 5 m (`"dataset"`), each tile's newest current edition | A GeoTIFF, read in place |

Results are cards, as in GeoLibre: a picture when the service has one, what the item is, who
shared it and when, and **Details** (its description, id and extent), **Portal** (its page),
**Zoom** (to its extent) and **Add**. A web map's **Add** lists its layers to add one by one. ArcGIS
portals keep a search to **All**, **Imagery**, **Maps**, **Features** or **Web maps**, list their
newest items when opened, and page with **Load more**.

The search by place (OpenAerialMap, LiDAR HD, 3DEP) is always where the map is, and its words, when
given, keep to the images or tiles that have them: OpenAerialMap's to 200 images where the map is
at a time (**Load more** looks at older ones), LiDAR HD's to the first 50 tiles. A Hugging Face
dataset lists its first 1,000 files, and the Ocean Data Platform's catalogue is read whole (a few
hundred datasets) and searched in RustGIS. In the web app, the Ocean Data Platform's features are
read through GeoLibre's relay (`tiles.geolibre.app`), the platform answering only its own site, so
those requests pass through it.

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'portal.search={"portal":"usgs-dem","bbox":[-122.25,46.15,-122.15,46.25]}'
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'portal.files={"dataset":"giswqs/geospatial"}'
rustgis-cli run --sample --cmd 'portal.add={"url":"https://data.geopf.fr/telechargement/download/LiDARHD-NUALID/NUALHD_1-0__LAZ_LAMB93_KE_2025-06-06/LHD_FXX_0652_6864_PTS_LAMB93_IGN69.copc.laz","name":"LiDAR HD 0652-6864"}'
```

## United States

**Home › Web Data › United States** holds services covering the United States: the
portals in the [Web services](#web-services) table (Tennessee GIS, US Federal, State and Local GIS,
USGS 3DEP DEM), [USGS LiDAR](#usgs-lidar), and the panels below.

### EnviroAtlas, FEMA NFHL and The National Map

**EnviroAtlas…** shows the US EPA's [EnviroAtlas](https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) services
(`https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services`) as a tree: folders, their services (**Add**
adds a service's whole map or image), and each service's layers, each with an **Add** of its own
(drawn alone). A search looks through the services of every folder and of the folders in them, a few folders at a time. **Add From Service** also browses
any ArcGIS services directory: its folders and the map, feature, image and vector tile services in them are listed
with **Open**, which lists that folder or service (**Back** returns). A map service offers its
whole map, each of its layers drawn alone (`… (map)`) and its layers' features. With commands,
`service.layers` on a directory lists its folders and services, each with the `url` to list next.

**FEMA NFHL…** lists the layers of FEMA's
[National Flood Hazard Layer](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/national-flood-hazard-layer) map
service (`https://hazards.fema.gov/arcgis/rest/services/public/NFHL/MapServer`), searched by
words: **Add** draws the whole map or one layer such as Flood Hazard Zones alone, and
**Features** downloads a layer's features in the view (up to the server's limit). Its flood layers are drawn only from zoom 15 (closer than about 1:36,000),
and FEMA's server can be slow to answer.

**The National Map…** lists 31 map services of the USGS
[The National Map](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/national-geospatial-program/national-map) and
partners by category (basemaps, hydrography, elevation, imagery, cartography, hazards, other data,
indexes), searched by words; **Add** adds one as a tile layer (the basemaps from their tile caches,
the others as images the server draws). `nationalMap.services` lists them and `nationalMap.add`
(`"service"`: an id or title) adds one:

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'nationalMap.add={"service":"basemap/USGSTopo"}' --cmd 'nationalMap.add={"service":"hydro/wbd"}' --cmd 'map.goToXY={"lon":-105.27,"lat":40.0,"scale":300000}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"topo.png"}'
```

### USGS NLDI

**Home › Web Data › United States › USGS NLDI…** uses the USGS
[Network-Linked Data Index](https://api.water.usgs.gov/nldi) on the NHDPlus river network, as
GeoLibre's NLDI panel does. Each result is a layer:

- **Flowline**: choose the whole flowline, or its part upstream or downstream of the point, and
  click the map (or type a longitude and latitude and press **Trace**, or **Map centre**). The
  flowline a raindrop falling there would reach is added, with the raindrop's path to it
  (`nldi.flowline`, the NLDI's flowtrace; when that fails, the nearest flowline and the way to it).
- **Basin from hydrolocation**: the basin draining to the flowline (`nldi.basin`).
- **Navigation**: pick upstream or downstream, main stem, tributaries or diversions, and a
  distance (1–9,999 km), and press **Load sources & plot**: the sources the navigation can list are
  loaded (`nldi.sources`) and the NHDPlus flowlines along it plotted (`nldi.navigate`). Pick another
  source (stream gages, water quality sites, wells, HUC12 pour points…) and press **Plot another
  navigation layer** to add it too.
- **Clear NLDI result** removes the layers the pane added.

The NLDI's server is sometimes slow or fails for a point it hasn't seen before: try again a little
later, or another point.

```sh
rustgis-cli run --sample --cmd 'nldi.flowline={"lon":-89.36083,"lat":43.08944}' --cmd 'nldi.basin={"comid":13293750}' --cmd 'nldi.navigate={"comid":13293750,"mode":"UM","distance":100}' --cmd 'nldi.navigate={"comid":13293750,"mode":"DM","distance":50,"source":"nwissite"}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"nldi.png"}'
```

## Satellite embeddings

**Home › Web Data › Satellite Embeddings…** shows pre-computed satellite embeddings: vectors a
geospatial foundation model made for every pixel or image patch, so that places alike have values
alike. Pick a dataset (its provider, model, resolution, years, coverage, licence and links are
shown), a year, and **Search where the map is**; the results are cards with **Zoom** and **Add**,
their footprints drawn as a layer.

| Dataset | What RustGIS does with it |
|---|---|
| **AlphaEarth Foundations** (Google's Satellite Embedding; 64 values a 10 m pixel, 2017–2025) | Finds the year's UTM tiles where the map is in the dataset's GeoParquet index on [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/tge-labs/aef), read in place (its bounding boxes, then the rows that meet the map). **Add** shows a tile as a cloud-optimised GeoTIFF read in place: three bands (**Bands**, from 1; A01, A16 and A09 by default) as red, green and blue, dequantised (`sign(v)·(v/127.5)²`) and stretched over ±**Stretch** (0.3). Only the three bands shown are read, a band at a time. **Apply to layers** shows other bands or another stretch on the tiles already added. |
| **Earth Index** (Earth Genome; 384 values every ~320 m, 2024) | Names the Sentinel-2 (MGRS) tiles where the map is and keeps those with a file. **Add points** reads the file's points in the view in place (every point's position, then the vectors of those in view: zoom to a few kilometres) and colours them by their vectors' first three principal components (64 colours); **Keep value** keeps one of each vector's values as the points' `value` field. |
| **Tessera** (Cambridge; 128 values a 10 m pixel, 2017–2025) | **Add view** reads three bands (1, 2 and 3 by default) of the view from Tessera's [Zarr store](https://data.source.coop/tessera/tessera/zarr/v1.1-dclimate) in place (the shard's index, then the chunks the view needs: at most about 6 km a side, its centre when the view is larger), as a 32-bit raster in UTM. |
| **Clay**, **Major TOM**, **Copernicus-Embed** | Listed with links to their data and papers; RustGIS doesn't read them. |

AlphaEarth's tiles keep their look in their layer's address (`#bands=2,17,10&range=-0.3,0.3&dequantize=aef`),
which `map.setTiles` changes for any cloud-optimised GeoTIFF read in place (`"bands"`, `"range"`,
`"dequantize"`); GeoTIFFs with their bands stored apart (planar), signed bytes and bottom-up images
are read in place too. The commands: `embeddings.datasets`, `embeddings.search` (`"dataset"`,
`"year"`, `"bbox"` or the view, `"footprints"`) and `embeddings.add` (`"dataset"`, `"url"`,
`"bands"`, `"stretch"`, `"dimension"`, `"bbox"`, `"year"`):

```sh
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'map.zoomToExtent={"extent":[-122.55,37.7,-122.3,37.85]}' --cmd 'embeddings.search={"dataset":"alphaearth","year":2024}' --cmd 'embeddings.add={"dataset":"alphaearth","url":"https://data.source.coop/tge-labs/aef/v1/annual/2024/10N/xcyo46pot2fg6a61t-0000008192-0000000000.tiff"}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"aef.png"}'
rustgis-cli run --cmd 'map.zoomToExtent={"extent":[-83.96,35.94,-83.9,35.98]}' --cmd 'embeddings.add={"dataset":"tessera","year":2024}' --cmd 'share.exportMap={"path":"tessera.png"}'
```

These reach the network: the AI Assistant asks first and plugins need the network permission.
