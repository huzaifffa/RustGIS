# Installation

## Install with an agent

Point your agent at the [RustGIS skill](https://github.com/opengeos/RustGIS/blob/main/skills/rustgis/SKILL.md)
and ask it to install RustGIS. The skill picks the platform, installs the app and `rustgis-cli`,
checks the release checksum, and registers the MCP server. The same skill is how an agent manages
the desktop app that is already open.

## Microsoft Store

On Windows 10 and 11, the easiest way to install RustGIS is from the Microsoft Store, which
signs the app and keeps it up to date:

## Download

Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/opengeos/RustGIS/releases/latest) carries ready-to-run
builds of the desktop app and `rustgis-cli`. The same files, grouped by platform, are mirrored at
**[downloads.rustgis.app](https://downloads.rustgis.app)**:

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Windows x64 (installer, no admin rights) | `RustGIS-<version>-windows-x86_64-setup.exe` |
| Windows x64 (installer for all users) | `RustGIS-<version>-windows-x86_64.msi` |
| Windows x64 (no install) | `RustGIS-<version>-windows-x86_64-portable.zip` (unzip and run `rustgis.exe`) |
| Windows x64 (Microsoft Store package) | `RustGIS-<version>-windows-x86_64.msix` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `RustGIS-<version>-macos-aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS Intel | `RustGIS-<version>-macos-x86_64.dmg` |
| Linux x64 / arm64 (Debian, Ubuntu) | `rustgis_<version>_amd64.deb` / `rustgis_<version>_arm64.deb` |
| Linux x64 / arm64 (Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE) | `rustgis-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm` / `rustgis-<version>-1.aarch64.rpm` |
| Linux x64 / arm64 (any distribution, no install) | `RustGIS-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` / `RustGIS-<version>-linux-aarch64.AppImage` |
| Linux x64 / arm64 (other) | `RustGIS-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` / `RustGIS-<version>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` |

On macOS the command-line tool is a separate `rustgis-cli-<version>-macos-<arch>.tar.gz`;
the other packages include it (the Windows installers and the MSIX add `rustgis-cli` to every
new terminal). `SHA256SUMS` lists the checksum of every file.

The AppImages carry update information, so tools such as Gear Lever can update them to the
latest release. AppImageUpdate, and AppImageLauncher through the AppImageUpdate library, download
only the parts that changed, with the `.zsync` file published beside each AppImage.

On Windows, `setup.exe` installs for your account in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\RustGIS` and needs
no admin rights; the `.msi` installs for every user in `Program Files` and suits managed
deployment (`msiexec /i RustGIS-<version>-windows-x86_64.msi /qn`). Both add a Start menu
entry, open `.rgis` projects, list RustGIS under **Open with** for `.geojson`, and
uninstall from **Settings › Apps**.

The `.msix` is the package submitted to the Microsoft Store, which signs it. It is unsigned
on the release page, so Windows only installs it from the
[Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ppjw8h561lq); outside the Store, download an installer
or the portable zip instead.

The macOS app needs macOS 11 or later. It is signed and notarized by Apple, so it opens without a
warning; the command-line tool is too, but macOS checks it online the first time it runs. The
`setup.exe`, `.msi` and portable zip are not signed: if SmartScreen warns about an unknown
publisher, choose **More info › Run anyway**.

## Package managers

RustGIS is also published to these package managers, which keep it up to date:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Windows ([winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/)) | `winget install OpenGeos.RustGIS` |
| macOS ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh)) | `brew install --cask opengeos/rustgis/rustgis` |
| macOS and Linux, command-line tool only (Homebrew) | `brew install opengeos/rustgis/rustgis-cli` |
| Arch Linux ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rustgis-bin)) | `yay -S rustgis-bin` (or any AUR helper) |
| Fedora ([COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/giswqs/rustgis/)) | `sudo dnf copr enable giswqs/rustgis && sudo dnf install rustgis` |

winget installs for your account with the setup.exe; add `--scope machine` for the `.msi`. On
Homebrew 5.1 and later, run `brew trust opengeos/rustgis` once before installing from the tap.
Each package is the same build as the release page, and a new release reaches the package
managers shortly after it is published (winget after Microsoft's review).

## From source

RustGIS builds from source with a recent stable Rust toolchain (1.90 or later), a C compiler (for
the bundled SQLite and the Zstandard decoder) and `curl` (to download the sample data).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opengeos/RustGIS.git
cd RustGIS
cargo run --release -p rustgis            # the desktop app
cargo build --release -p rustgis-cli      # the command-line tool
```

The build downloads the Natural Earth sample data from
[rustgis-assets](https://github.com/opengeos/rustgis-assets). To build offline, download
`countries.geojson`, `countries_chn.geojson`, `cities.geojson`, `rivers.geojson` and
`lakes.geojson` from `https://assets.rustgis.app/data/` once and point the build at them:

```sh
RUSTGIS_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data cargo build --release
```

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Linux (X11 and Wayland) | Supported |
| macOS | Supported |
| Windows | Supported |
| Web browser | Supported: [web.rustgis.app](https://web.rustgis.app) (WebGPU or WebGL2), installable as an app on iOS, Android and desktops ([how](#install-the-web-app)) |

## Web app

RustGIS also runs in the browser, compiled to WebAssembly: open
**[web.rustgis.app](https://web.rustgis.app)**. It is the same app, with these differences:

- **Open** and **Add Data** use the browser's file picker, and you can drop files on the page.
  GeoJSON, CSV, GeoTIFF, ASCII grids, `.rgis` projects and the other formats in
  [Data formats](user-guide/data-formats.md) work; pick or drop a Shapefile's `.shp` and `.dbf`
  together (with its `.shx` and `.prj` if it has them), or its zip.
- **Save** and **Export** download the file. **Save As**, and the first **Save** of a project,
  ask for the file name first; the browser decides which folder downloads go to (Firefox, for
  one, saves to its Downloads folder unless told to ask). A project opened from a file is named
  after it, and **Save** downloads it under that name again.
- The interface uses the built-in font, because a web page can't read installed fonts. Choosing
  Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Persian downloads a font for that script.
- Process plugins (including Python plugins), and the formats read through GDAL or DuckDB,
  need the desktop app or `rustgis-cli`.

The web app opens the way **Settings › Start-up** says (remembered in the browser). The URL can
override that for one visit: add `?blank` to start with an empty project,
`?projection=EPSG:3010` (a supported projected EPSG or ESRI code, a preset id such as `robinson`, or `globe`) to
start in another projection, `?extent=10.5,55,24.5,69.5` (west, south, east, north in degrees) to
open on an area, `?lang=de` (or any language code) to pick the interface language, `?gpu` (or
`?gpu=0`) to turn GPU Rendering on (off) for the visit, or `?webgl` to force
WebGL2. Combine them with `&`, so a self-hosted build can link to
`?blank&projection=EPSG:3010&extent=10.5,55,24.5,69.5`.

`?registry=<address>` opens the Plugin Manager's Browse tab on another plugin registry for the
visit; installing still asks first.

Links can carry data too: `?data=<address>` adds a file by its web address (any format Add Data
reads, downloaded in the background; repeat it for up to 16, and the map zooms to the first that
lands with something to show), `?style=<address>` adds a MapLibre style (opening at the style's
own place, zoom, bearing and pitch unless the link places the map), `?tiles=<template>`
a tile layer, and `?zarr=<address>` opens Add Zarr Variable on a Zarr store. Percent-encode an address holding `&`, `#` or spaces (`encodeURIComponent`); a `+`
stays a `+`. The server must allow the browser to fetch the file (CORS); a file that can't be
added is said in a notice. For example,
`?blank&data=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_week.geojson` opens
the past week's earthquakes.

A MapLibre-style position after a `#` places the map: `#zoom/latitude/longitude/bearing/pitch`,
the last two optional, so `?style=<address>#15.5/40.7484/-73.9857/30/60` opens a style tilted over
Midtown Manhattan.

`?project=<address>` opens a whole project by its web address: a `.rgis` file (or a
`.rgispkg` package), or any address that answers with a project's JSON, such as an API that
builds the project on the fly. Its maps, layers, symbology and view open as saved, so one link
shares a styled map. The project replaces the start-up one, so `?data=`, `?stac=`, `?style=`,
`?tiles=` and `?zarr=` are left out beside it (a notice says so). The data the project points to
is read as it would be from a saved file, and its servers must allow the browser to fetch it
(CORS), as must the project's.

`?stac=<address>` opens STAC Search on a [STAC](https://stacspec.org) item or collection: an
item's footprint is drawn and its default asset (its true-colour `visual` image, else its first
GeoTIFF) added, signed first when it is a Microsoft Planetary Computer one; a collection is chosen
in the dialog, with its API, ready to search. For example,
`?stac=https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1/collections/sentinel-2-l2a/items/S2B_MSIL2A_20240727T102559_R108_T32TLS_20240727T131405`
opens a Sentinel-2 scene of Lake Geneva.

`?embed` runs the app inside another page, as the [Python package's notebook widget](python.md)
does: it starts blank, keeps its settings in memory rather than in the browser, and exchanges
the project with the page that frames it through `postMessage` (the messages are described in
`apps/rustgis-web/src/embed.rs`).

### Install the web app

The web app installs like an app on phones, tablets and computers, with its own icon and a window
without the browser's toolbars, and starts without a network connection once it has been opened
online. Nothing is downloaded from an app store, and it updates itself from web.rustgis.app.

| Platform | How |
| --- | --- |
| iPhone and iPad | Open web.rustgis.app in Safari, tap **Share**, then **Add to Home Screen** |
| Android | Open it in Chrome, tap the **⋮** menu, then **Install app** (or **Add to Home screen**) |
| Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS | In Chrome or Edge, click the install icon at the right of the address bar (or **⋮ › Cast, save and share › Install page as app**) |
| Mac (Safari 17 or later) | **File › Add to Dock** |

To remove it, delete it like any other app: long-press the icon on a phone or tablet, or use
**Uninstall** in the app window's menu on a computer.

Offline, the installed app opens the World Atlas sample and the files you open, but not basemap
tiles, web data, plugins or the AI Assistant, which need the network. When a new version has been
published while the app is open, a notice offers to reload into it; otherwise the next launch
picks it up. Two things to know on iPhone and iPad: iOS gives a web page less memory than a
desktop browser, so very large rasters may not open, and it can clear the offline copy when the
device runs short of storage, so the next launch then needs a connection.

To build it yourself, install [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev), the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
and clang (it compiles the Zstandard decoder used for GeoTIFFs to WebAssembly). Linux
distributions' clang can; on macOS, Apple's can't, so install `llvm` with Homebrew and put its
`bin` first on your `PATH`. Then:

```sh
cd apps/rustgis-web
trunk serve          # http://127.0.0.1:8772
trunk build --release   # output in dist/web
cargo xtask web-pwa ../../dist/web   # add the service worker (offline start), as the deploy does
```

The service worker is left out of `trunk serve`, so a development build is never served from a
stale cache.

## Fonts

RustGIS uses an installed sans-serif when it finds one (Segoe UI, San Francisco, Arial, Inter,
Noto Sans, Open Sans or DejaVu Sans) and falls back to a built-in face. Set
`RUSTGIS_BUILTIN_FONTS=1` to always use the built-in face.

## Settings, data and cache folders

The desktop app and the command line keep their files in three folders:

| Folder | Holds | Windows | macOS | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | preferences (`prefs.json`), the crash log, AI Assistant sign-ins and skills | `%APPDATA%\RustGIS` | `~/Library/Application Support/RustGIS` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rustgis` (`~/.config/rustgis`) |
| Data | installed plugins, the GeoLibre runner and recovery copies of unsaved work | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RustGIS` | `~/Library/Application Support/RustGIS` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rustgis` (`~/.local/share/rustgis`) |
| Cache | GDAL and DuckDB conversions | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RustGIS\cache` | `~/Library/Caches/RustGIS` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rustgis` (`~/.cache/rustgis`) |

Set `RUSTGIS_CONFIG_DIR`, `RUSTGIS_APP_DATA_DIR` or `RUSTGIS_CACHE_DIR` to use another folder
instead, for a portable install on a USB drive, for example. The folder is used as is, and RustGIS
keeps the same files in it (`plugins/`, `geolibre/` and `recovery/` in the data folder, `gdal/` and `duckdb/`
in the cache folder). `RUSTGIS_PLUGINS_DIR`, `RUSTGIS_GDAL_CACHE` and `RUSTGIS_DUCKDB_CACHE` name
the plugins folder and the GDAL and DuckDB caches themselves, ahead of these.

## If RustGIS closes unexpectedly

The desktop app writes its internal errors to `crash.log` in its
[settings folder](#settings-data-and-cache-folders): one that closed the app, and also one it
recovered from (an error in the AI Assistant, for example, stops the request and says so in the
chat instead of closing the app). The next launch moves the log to `crash-last.log` and names the
file in a notice.

Attach it to a [bug report](https://github.com/opengeos/RustGIS/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
It holds the version, the operating system, the error message and where in RustGIS it happened.
An error message can quote what RustGIS was working on, such as a file path or a layer name, so
read the log first and remove anything you don't want to share.

Unsaved work isn't lost with it: the next launch offers the copy autosave kept (see
[Autosave and recovery](user-guide/workspace.md#autosave-and-recovery)).

## If the app doesn't start

The desktop app draws its window with the graphics card through Direct3D 12 on Windows, Metal on
macOS and Vulkan on Linux, with OpenGL as a fallback. A graphics driver that crashes there closes
the app before it can open a window or write `crash.log`. Choose another graphics interface with
`--backend` (`dx12`, `vulkan`, `gl` or `metal`, or several separated by commas), from a terminal
or in the target of a shortcut to `rustgis.exe`:

```sh
rustgis --backend gl       # OpenGL
rustgis --backend dx12     # Direct3D 12 (Windows)
rustgis --backend vulkan   # Vulkan
rustgis --backend metal    # Metal (macOS)
```

The `WGPU_BACKEND` environment variable takes the same names, for every launch. On Windows,
RustGIS uses Vulkan only when asked like this: some Vulkan drivers, such as Intel's for UHD 600
series graphics, crash as the app starts. Updating the graphics driver may also help.
