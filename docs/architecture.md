# Architecture

RustGIS is a layered Cargo workspace. Lower layers never depend on the UI, which keeps the
engine scriptable and the front end swappable.

| Layer | Crate | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | `rustgis-geom` | Coordinates, extents, Web Mercator, geodesic distance/area, scale |
| L1 | `rustgis-data` | Features and typed attributes; GeoJSON, CSV, Shapefile; a read-only SQLite file reader (`sqlite`, for GeoPackages in the browser); data providers reading GeoPackage, GeoParquet and FlatGeobuf in place by their spatial index, and PostGIS, MySQL and MariaDB tables live (desktop) (GDAL formats and DuckDB queries converted by those programs when installed); SQL where clauses; rasters (GeoTIFF, ASCII grid) and their coordinate systems |
| L2 | `rustgis-map`, `rustgis-analysis` | Layers, symbology, labeling, camera, basemaps and web tile layers; geoprocessing tools |
| L2 | `rustgis-tiles` | Web map tiles: XYZ/TMS/WMS raster tiles, Mapbox Vector Tiles, PMTiles and MBTiles archives and a subset of MapLibre styles; a cache that fetches in the background (worker threads natively, the browser's `fetch` on the web) |
| L3 | `rustgis-render` | tiny-skia renderer, label placement, PNG export |
| L3 | `rustgis-geolibre` | The [GeoLibre tools](user-guide/analysis.md#geolibre-tools) as geoprocessing tools: run by the optional `geolibre` program natively, by geolibre-rust's WASI runner in the browser |
| L3 | `rustgis-plugins` | [Plugins](plugins.md): sandboxed WebAssembly modules that add commands and geoprocessing tools; `.rgplugin` packages and the plugin registry |
| L4 | `rustgis-engine` | Session, undo, command registry, sample project |
| L5 | `rustgis-assistant` | The [AI Assistant](user-guide/assistant.md): a chat agent that acts through commands; OpenAI-compatible, OpenAI Responses (a ChatGPT plan's sign-in), Anthropic and Gemini wire formats as plain request/response data, so the desktop (a thread), the browser (`fetch`) and the command line share one loop |
| L6 | `rustgis-ui-egui` | The ribbon front end |
| apps | `rustgis`, `rustgis-cli`, `rustgis-web` | Desktop app, command line, browser (WebAssembly) |

## Everything is a command

Each user-visible action is a `CommandSpec` with an id, label, ribbon location, shortcut,
parameter description, an `enabled` check and a `run` function. The ribbon, keyboard shortcuts,
command search and CLI all dispatch through `Session::run`, which also snapshots the project
for undo and restores it if a command fails.

Plugin commands (`plugin:<plugin>/<command>`) dispatch through `Session::run` too, as one undo
step. While they run, they reach the session only through permission-checked requests (see
[Plugins](plugins.md)).

## Never crash

Production code avoids `unwrap`, `expect` and panics, and treats file contents and command
parameters as hostile. Tests run every command and every geoprocessing tool with junk
parameters.

## Quality gates

```sh
cargo xtask ci        # fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, layering check
```
