//! A loopback relay: an MCP client drives the session of the desktop app that is already open.
//!
//! The app starts a listener with its `ui.mcpRelay` command (off until then), and
//! `rustgis-cli mcp --attach` connects to it. The relay is the same [`crate::mcp`] protocol as
//! `rustgis-cli mcp`, one JSON-RPC message per line, so there is no second command protocol:
//! every action reaches the open [`Session`] through [`Session::run`], one undo step per command,
//! exactly as the private-session server does.
//!
//! Safety: the listener binds 127.0.0.1 only ([`Relay::bind`] refuses any other address before
//! opening a socket). Each run draws a token from the operating system's random source and writes
//! it to a private file ([`token_path`]); a connection is dropped unless its first message is the
//! relay's `rustgis/attach` carrying that token. The attach's `access` flag then decides what that
//! connection allows; the existing [`Server::refusal`] policy still runs per call.
//!
//! Limits: connections, unauthenticated connections, queued messages, the first line before the
//! token is checked, and every read and write wait are bounded. A command whose reply does not
//! come in time is cancelled before the app can run it. Stopping the relay, or dropping its last
//! owner, closes the listener and every client and removes the token file.
