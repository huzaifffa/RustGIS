//! L5: the AI assistant. A chat agent that answers questions about the map and acts on it by
//! running RustGIS commands and geoprocessing tools, through a model of the user's choosing
//! (Anthropic, OpenAI, a ChatGPT account, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible
//! server).
//!
//! - [`provider`]: the four wire formats, as plain request/response data.
//! - [`chatgpt`]: signing in with ChatGPT, so the user's ChatGPT plan is used instead of a key.
//! - [`tools`]: what the model may call, and which calls need the user's approval.
//! - [`agent`]: the conversation loop, without I/O, so the desktop (a thread), the browser
//!   (`fetch`), the command line and the tests drive the same code.
//! - [`http`]: the blocking transport for the desktop and the command line.
//! - [`mcp`]: the same tools for any Model Context Protocol client (`rustgis-cli mcp`).
//! - [`docs`]: the documentation, built in, for MCP clients to search and read.
