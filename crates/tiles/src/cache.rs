//! The tile cache: every tile and document fetched, decoded, by address.
//!
//! Drawing never waits. [`get`] answers what the cache holds and, for an address it doesn't hold
//! yet, starts fetching it; when the bytes arrive they are decoded, [`generation`] goes up and
//! the waker (the app's repaint) is called, so the map draws again with the new tile. Exports
//! and the command line, which can't draw a half-loaded map, [`wait`] for the fetches first.
//!
//! Natively, tiles are fetched on worker threads, the newest request first (the view the user is
//! looking at now, not the one they panned away from), a limited number at a time from each
//! server. The browser app installs its own fetcher with [`set_fetcher`].
